A) this is a sql injection problem where the paramaters fromt he user are passed directly to the data base without any
checking or security measures taken.

B)
if an astronaut entered ' OR '1'='1 then the string interpreted by the SQL would be OR 1=1 which means the query'd be:
SELECT * FROM secret_missions WHERE access_code = OR 1=1
the effect would be returning any data that fit those parameters.



C)
Rewrite the code:
I would make it so that the code is only numbers so that nobody can send any letters in the query.
try{
    String secretcode = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("access_code"));
    String query = "SELECT * FROM secret_missions WHERE access_code = '"+ secretcode +"'";
    } catch(NumberFormatException e){
    System.Out.Println("NumberFormatException, there are letters here, nice try");
    }

this way there is no capability for letters to be turned into words. now if we want to have letters or must have them
what i would do is simply turn all letters into the ascii values so that no letters are ever passed to the SQL Query.
This way even if they do pass letters, they are never read as characters, only numbers.
