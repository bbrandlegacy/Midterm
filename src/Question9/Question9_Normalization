1) primary key is unique for astronaut_ID and unique for Mission_name but are in the same table with all other data
 and things can be identifiable but there is redundant data that is dependent on each other. we have a composite key
.mission name may be unique here ut it will not always be, so everything having to do with the mission should be a
separate table, and who is associated should be in a separate table.

2) we ned two tables to make it into 3NF
    first table would be astronauts with columns: astronaut_id, astronaut_name
    second table would be mission_launch with columns: mission_name, launch_site, site_code, site_country
    third table would be missions with columns: mission_id,astronaut,mission

3)
CREATE TABLE missions (
    mission_id int auto_increment primary_key
    astronaut varchar(30) not null
    mission varchar(30) not null
)

CREATE TABLE astronauts(
    astronaut_id int autoincrement primary_key
    astronaut_name varchar(30) not null
)

CREATE TABLE mission_launch(
    mission_name varchar(30) primary_key
    launch_site varchar(30) not null
    site_code varchar(3)
    site_country varchar(30)
)
