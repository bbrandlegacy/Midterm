This structure is mimicking a stack, first in last out
the problem here is that as it would have plenty of logic to go against what is being sought after as a
functionality limitation. Extending ArrayList would let you do more than you would would want and would also not
 maintain the structure of a stack due to pointer issues.

first there may not be a book at index 0 (if the bookshelf is full) also if it is full assuming we start adding books
at index 0 once there are books then there would be empty space and the bookshelf would not be modelled correctly
when there is supposed to be a book as there is in real life it is missing. which means the next time you add a
book it will be off by one space and that will continue to create more and more issues.

first off i would simply implement the Stack class as java already fixed all these things. then if we need anything
 specific to happen special to books we can override some implementations. if im not allowed to give this as an answer
  i would model the stack class. if i still cant say that, then i would simply override the arraylist functions that
  cause issues with logic necessary to represent that limitations imposed by the design of the bookshelf.
