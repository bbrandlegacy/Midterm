"Rest and activity are the steps of progress"

in more ways than one this applicable. first we look at it from the perspective of in the moment actuation. When we
are working it is important to be active DO the work. then after some time where enough work has been done (a complete
thought or enough information where the context is complete) we then review, we rest, take a moment to relax from
creation and admire, observe, and interact rather than change.

on the macro scale, its really important to maximize our output capabilities by resting appropriately in order to
revitalize ourselves to be at maximum focus during activity. Each time progress is made. Progress couldn't be made if we
did not take rest as slowly the progress quality would go down and after a certain point you may THINK you are doing
work but you are really moving nowhere, you are going in circles.
